# usage

As yet I haven't implimented instructions in app so here you go:

    You are at war with Australia and of course the quickest way to get to the them is through the center of the earth. You need to choose what pieces of scrap to toss down that hole and someone in Australia will do the same to you(randomly generated opponent).
    When you first load you will have to search the scrapyard for scrap, hover over the scrap for a description of what it does. Drag the scrap that you want into the yellow boxes on the left and when you are happen 'Toss' them down the hole.
    Various statistics are tracked and displayed on the right hand side.

I took initial inspiration from Super Auto Pets. The more I learnt about coding, the more I felt I might be able to impliment something like that.

I hope you enjoy!

# installation

If you want to run locally you will have to download Flutter yourself: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

Clone this repo and make sure flutter doctor shows all ticks. On VS code run debug mode from lib/main.dart.
